# GoSquares
SImple game entirely written in JavaScript

Mostly broken and to be updated ASAP! :)

## Test-drive
### Clone and go to directory's game
```
git clone git@github.com:7rin0/goquares.git
cd goquares
```

### Install dependencies and Run
#### Quickest way
```
make run
```
#### Procedural way
```
- npm install
- ./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server -o
```

> If you have already http-server package installed globally you can simply run ```http-server -o``` of the gosquares directory root. This is the simplest way to test gosquares.

## TODO:
- Debug ...
- Test coverage
- Sanity checking
- Code review
- Migrate as Android and Chrome application


Feel free to contribute :)
